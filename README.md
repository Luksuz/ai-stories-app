# AI Stories Generator

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project is an AI-powered Stories Generator that allows users to input a storyline or prompt and generates a sequence of 5 story parts, each accompanied by dynamically generated images that illustrate the scenes described. Users also have the option to introduce random events that alter the storyline between story parts. The application is built with React.js on the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB on the backend.
